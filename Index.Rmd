# Quick Overview

## Column 1

### Outline

The IMP>ACT project implies that we will validate the instruments developed during the project. One of the types of analyses we will rely on is 'Confirmatory Factor Analysis' (CFA). Different statistical software packages can handle this type of analyses, but most of them are not for free. A powerful tool in data analysis world is `R`, an open-source statistical software package. The last decade or so, `R`has become more and more popular among researchers. It has many advantages, like the fact that it is fully open source and therefore a great way to conduct open science.

In this workshop we will lay the foundation for a unified way of doing analyses, making use of `R`within the IMP>ACT project. Given the limited amount of time, we will very briefly introduce how to generate a good reproducible workflow in `R` and we will delve into the use of the package `lavaan`for the specific CFA analyses. 

This website will contain links to the slides, the data used in the workshop, some external resources, and potential other sources of relevant information.

# Preparation

## Column 1

### How to prepare?

To prepare yourself for the workshop it would be great that you have installed `R`and `RStudio`on you personal computer. 

Important to know is that `R` has to be installed first and that `RStudio` is user-interface that facilitates a proper workflow to work with `R`. So, `R` is the statistical programming language used and `RStudio` will be the interface where we will apply `R`. 

To install `R` you can go to the website of CRAN where you can download the most recent version of `R` for you machine: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="blank">CRAN website</a>

To install `RStudio` you can go to the website of POSIT where you can download the most recent version of `R` for you machine: <a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/" target="blank">posit website</a>

# Workshop materials

## Column 1

### Part 1

In the first part, we will introduce the basics of `R` language and the `RStudio` environment. 
Following topics will be discussed:

- RStudio interface 
- The basics in R 
- Using a Quarto document
- Installing and using packages
- Importing data 

### Part 2

The second part taps into the package `lavaan`to conduct the CFA's.

These will be topics covered:

- The `lavaan` syntax 
- Estimating a model 
- Evaluating the model
- Modification indices
- Comparing models
- Measurement Invariance Analysis

### Project template

For the workshop we developed a template project. I advice strongly to make use of Projects in RStudio for each of you specific studies. For instance, if you want to conduct a CFA on a specific dataset, create a separate project for this endeavor. This way, all the file from a specific study are bundled together without the clutter of other files. 

A project in RStudio has a dedicated folder on your computer. Within that folder I typically create dedicated sub-folders. This folder structure is the folder structure in the template project:

- `analysis` = a folder containing files that document specific analyses (e.g., a Quarto document with the lab notes for a certain study)
- `data`= a folder with the raw data files (I tend to store only the raw data there, so that I always have the source material stored)
- `doc`= a folder with some background documentation on the study (e.g., the Questionnaires or other instruments, a description of the design, ...) 
- `output` = a folder with specific output files (e.g., graphics/plots, derived datasets, feedback for participants, ...)
- `src` = a folder with some specific resources necessary to understand the study (e.g., some tutorial used, ...)

The template project for this workshop (and for IMP>ACT) is stored on Github. It can be accessed through this link:
https://github.com/Sdemaeyer2/IMPACT_Project_template

If you open this link in your web browser, you can download the whole folder to your local computer by clicking on the "Code" button. That gives you the opportunity to save it as a Zip file.

### Dataset

The data used in the example project comes from the KAU-team (many thanks!) and contains survey data on Action Competence.

### More on Lavaan

`lavaan` is developed at the University of Ghent by Yves Rosseel. His ambition was to build a package in `R` that mimics the analyses possible in MPlus. Given that the development of such an open source package relies heavily on particpation of contributors, `lavaan` is sometimes a bit behind with the more recent advanced analyses possible in MPlus. Nevertheless, `lavaan` has grown a lot as package and meets all the standards to conduct Structural Equation Modeling. 

There is a great online tutorial build by the developer himself to explain the use of `lavaan`. You can find it here: <https://lavaan.ugent.be/>.

### More on Quarto

Quarto can be used for much more than just writing single documents. More info on all possibilities of Quarto can be found here:
<https://quarto.org/docs/guide/>

If you create a file (or a website) that you want to publish on internet there are many ways to do so. More information here:
<https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/>

You can even create a personal (academic) blog website with Quarto. Great tutorial can be found here:
<https://www.marvinschmitt.com/blog/website-tutorial-quarto/>

## Column 2

### Example publication using lavaan

In 2024 Michiel and some of us have published a study where we tested the measurement invariance of the ACiSD-Q. For this study we also used `lavaan`. The study can be found here: <https://doi.org/10.1080/13504622.2024.2382967>. The code for the analyses is also openly available at OSF: <https://osf.io/xq9wc/?view_only=69536ba32fcc40cba3e9573f332a5c1b>

### Example application of Quarto

Quarto allows you to create nice documents like *lab-notes* or *walk-throughs*. For instance, I have created this document as an appendix of a paper. This is made with Quarto and is an html page that lives on the internet:
